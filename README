About
-----

FamaMonetae decodes data stored as Bitcoin addresses in a Bitcoin
transaction.

FamaMonetae depends on the python-bitcoinlib and python-bitcoinrpc
libraries.

Execution
---------

Adjust the username, password, server, and port variables within the
famamonetae.py file in order to access the desired HTTP JSON-RPC Bitcoin
server.

Supply the desired transaction id as an argument to FamaMonetae. For
example (where '<txid>' is the transaction id):

    # ./famamonetae.py <txid>

All output Bitcoin addresses in the specified Bitcoin transaction will
be decoded to binary data and written to a file called rumor.dat in the
current directory.
