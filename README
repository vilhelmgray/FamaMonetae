About
-----

FamaMonetae encodes/decodes data via the Bitcoin protocol.

FamaMonetae depends on the python-bitcoinlib and python-bitcoinrpc
libraries.

Execution
---------

FamaMonetae provides the hearRumor function to decode a Bitcoin
transaction to data and save the concatenated data to a file.

The hearRumor function takes three string arguments: the Bitcoin
transaction ID, the url to an HTTP JSON-RPC Bitcoin server, and the
filepath to store the decoded data.

For example, suppose the choosen Bitcoin transaction ID is
"8881a937a437ff6ce83be3a89d77ea88ee12315f37f7ef0dd3742c30eef92dba" and
the decoded data should be saved to a file called "rumor.dat" in the
current directory; a local HTTP JSON-RPC Bitcoin server is located at
127.0.0.1 on port 8332 and accessed using "user" as the username and
"pass" as the password. The following Python script will do:

        import famamonetae

        txid = ("8881a937a437ff6ce83be3a89d77ea88"
                "ee12315f37f7ef0dd3742c30eef92dba")
        service_url = "http://user:pass@127.0.0.1:8332"
        rumor_file = "rumor.dat"

        famamonetae.hearRumor(txid, service_url, rumor_file)

After executing the Python script, the file "rumor.dat" will contain the
decoded data.
